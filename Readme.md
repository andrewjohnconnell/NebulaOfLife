#Nebula of Life
This was just a quickie in swing.  Always find Conway's Game of Life mesmerizing and wanted to see what impact a fade in / fade out effect would have on the cells as they are born / live / die.  What I've come up with is a rather lovely nebula to begin with, which fades into a night sky.  Have thrown a random 1 in a million mutation for dead cells into the mix, so that (theoretically) there will never be a stabilised system.  I think it's quite lovely.  If you've got enough power in your machine, whack this up to 800 * 600 resolution (a cell covers a pixel, so working out the next frame through the CPU can get taxing on 1920 * 1080 on an i7).

## How to play
Compile and run.  Main() is in the programholder class.

## Credits
All credit to Conway for coming up with the rules for the Game of Life.  A very enjoyable morning putting this together.
